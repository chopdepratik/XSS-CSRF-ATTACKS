            Forgery (CSRF)
            vulnerabilities. Through simple, interactive examples, you'll learn how attackers exploit insecure web
            applications using these techniques, and how developers can safeguard their code against such threats. This

            <h2>What is XSS?</h2>

            <p>
                Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a widespread and dangerous security vulnerability that occurs when a web
                application
                allows untrusted data—typically user input—to be injected into web pages without proper validation or
                sanitization.
                When this malicious input is rendered as executable code in the browser, attackers can manipulate how
                the
                page behaves
                for other users who view it.
            </p>

            <p>
                XSS exploits the trust a user places in a website. By injecting malicious JavaScript code, attackers can
                cause a range
                of harmful outcomes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Stealing sensitive data, such as login credentials, personal information, or cookies</li>
                <li>Hijacking user sessions, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim</li>
                <li>Redirecting users to phishing or malware-laden websites</li>
                <li>Defacing content or altering the behavior of the page to mislead users</li>
                <li>Spying on users' activities, including logging keystrokes or capturing screen contents</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Way to perform XSS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>🔍 <strong>Reflected XSS</strong>: The injected script is reflected off a web server, such as in a
                    search result or error message.</li>
                <li>💾 <strong>Stored XSS</strong>: The injected script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database)
                    and
                    served to users later.</li>
                <li>🧠 <strong>DOM-based XSS</strong>: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code, where the
                    script
                    modifies the DOM without proper validation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is CSRF?</h2>
            <p>
                Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a deceptive and dangerous web security vulnerability that enables
                attackers to
                impersonate a trusted user by exploiting their authenticated session. When a user is logged into a web
                application,
                their browser automatically includes authentication credentials (like cookies or session tokens) with
                every
                request.
                CSRF attacks take advantage of this behavior to trick the browser into submitting unauthorized requests
                without the
                user's awareness or intention.
            </p>

            <p>Attackers can exploit CSRF vulnerabilities to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>🔒 Change user account settings (e.g., email or password)</li>
                <li>💸 Perform financial transactions (like initiating a funds transfer)</li>
                <li>🗑️ Delete important data or deactivate user accounts</li>
                <li>📨 Send spam or messages through the user's account</li>
                <li>👁️ Escalate privileges or manipulate site configurations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Way to perform CSRF</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a malicious link: An attacker can create a link that, when clicked, performs an action on
                    behalf
                    of the user.</li>
                <li>Embedding malicious code: An attacker can embed code in a web page that automatically submits a
                    request
                    to another site where the user is authenticated.</li>
                <li>Using social engineering: An attacker can trick a user into performing an action that results in a
                    CSRF
                    attack.</li>
